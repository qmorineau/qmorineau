# Quentin Morineau
## Software Developer | 42 Trainee | Brussels

I am a Software Developer at 42 Belgium, transitioning from a 12-year career as a Pastry Chef in international environments. My focus is on low-level C/C++, system optimization, and graphics programming. I apply the same rigor and precision required in professional kitchens to memory management and code performance.

## Key Technical Projects

### [FDF (Wireframe Visualizer) | C (MiniLibX)](https://github.com/qmorineau/fdf)

* Built a 3D graphic engine to render topographic data as wireframe meshes.

* Implemented spherical projections to visualize planetary maps (Earth/Moon) with altitude-based color mapping.

* Focus: Matrix transformations and coordinate systems.

### [Transcendence (Real-Time Gaming Platform) | TypeScript / Node.js](https://github.com/qmorineau/transcendance)

* Developed a full-stack Pong platform featuring a centralized, authoritative game engine for cheat-proof multiplayer synchronization.

* Engineered a decoupled backend architecture supporting simultaneous real-time sessions across 3D Web and SSH-based CLI clients.

* Focus: Authoritative state management, Real-time networking, and System architecture.

### [ft_ls (System Listing Utility) | C](https://github.com/qmorineau/ft_ls)

* Engineered a performance-oriented clone of the Unix `ls` command, achieving execution speeds within **~1.1x** of the native GNU utility.

* Implemented **statx(2) masking** to minimize kernel-to-userland data overhead and a **Custom Pool Allocator** to eliminate memory fragmentation during massive recursive traversals.

* Optimized output performance using a **16 KB cache-aligned buffer**, ensuring formatting occurs at peak CPU speeds before syscall execution.

* **Focus:** Kernel-level efficiency, Memory Locality, and System Benchmarking.
