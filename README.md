# Welcome ðŸ‘‹ 

Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm **Quentin Morineau**, a passionate and enthusiastic developer. I love to explore new technologies and contribute to exciting projects that challenge and enhance my skills. Here's a brief overview of who I am and what I bring to the coding table.
<br>

## About Me
I am a **full-stack developer** trainee with a background as a pastry chef. For a few months,<br> I've been on a continuous learning path, expanding my knowledge and honing my skills in various areas.
<br>
## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

- Markup Languages: Markdown, HTML
- Frontend: CSS, SASS, Javascript, React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Java
- Databases: MongoDB, MySQL

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning 

I'm always striving to learn and grow. Here are some of the technologies I'm currently diving into:

- C-Programming (I'll be part of 42 campus really soon)
- Object-Oriented Programming (Java)
- Unit testing (JUnit for Java)
- Spring (Java framework)

## ðŸš€ Projects 

I believe in learning by doing, and here are a few projects that showcase my skills and interests:

[A+ Studio](https://github.com/qmorineau/A-Plus-Studio-Figma): This is just a static page I made during my training.

[BeMovies](https://github.com/qmorineau/BeMovies-App): This one was a group project during my training. I remade all of it before learning React.js.

[2048 Clone](https://github.com/qmorineau/2048-Game-Clone): Let's get back in 2014 with this clone project. I did it to challenge myself with the algorithm. Enjoy it :)


Feel free to explore these projects and provide any feedback or suggestions you may have. In the future, I plan to undertake several Java projects as I continue to learn the language, focusing on smaller-scale endeavors for now.
